I'm Bradley Glover, a Senior Engineer focused on DevOps, Site Reliability, Cloud Infrastructure, and a little bit of programming as well.

I've owned this domain for a few years now, and have never really done anything with it outside of using it for a more professional email ([email me!](mailto:bradley@bradleyglover.com)).
So, I'd like to use this blog as an opportunity to work on interesting (to me) projects, and share my experience.

The first topic I'll explore in the next post is how I started and hosted this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) -- plus Terraform!
